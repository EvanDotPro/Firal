Introduction
------------
The Firal CMS is a simple CMS based on the Zend Framework. We focus on
extensibility and useability. We use BSD licensing.

Currently, the CMS is very simple. It only contains basic classes for the models
and a basic authentication module. We are working on more features like caching
and decent module support.
